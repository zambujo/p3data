# P3_data

The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the leading public science funding agency in Switzerland, provides public data sets containing information on each grant and grantee.  

The data sets contain high-quality data.  The data and corresponding data dictionary explaining the variables are found [here](http://p3.snf.ch/Pages/DataAndDocumentation.aspx).

Here you find an analysis of part of these data in the following 3 notebooks:

 - [Data cleaning](./cleaning.ipynb) 
 - [Data exploration](./exploration.ipynb) 
 - [Insights](./slide_deck.ipynb)
